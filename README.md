# Price-Prediction
Our price prediction model utilizes a Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) neural network to forecast future price movements based on historical market data. It processes features such as Open, High, Low, and Close prices, with lagging indicators to capture temporal dependencies. The data is standardized using Standard Scaler, and the model comprises multiple LSTM layers, with the final layer using a linear activation function for regression. Trained using Mean Absolute Error (MAE) or Mean Squared Error (MSE) as the loss function and optimized with Adam optimizer, the model is evaluated on metrics like MAE and RMSE. A time-based train-test split ensures proper validation, and hyperparameters such as epochs, batch size, and learning rate are fine-tuned for optimal performance. The trained model is deployed using Streamlit, allowing users to input the latest data and receive predictions in real-time.
